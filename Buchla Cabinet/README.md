Buchla-Cabinet
==============

CAD files from my Buchla Cabinet design.

I believe I used CadSTD to draw them. It is free: www.cadstd.com

I think they open at Autocad too, but I'm not sure.

Here's where I first posted them. I regret how I simply disappeared from the internet after I posted those files :(
